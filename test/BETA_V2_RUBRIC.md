# CLAWD BETA SUITE v2 — RUBRIC + EXTENDED BANK (code-grounded)

Source of truth: container/sub-agent/src/{commands,reminders,consent,main}.py, tools/__init__.py,
src/cloud/admin-dashboard/index.ts (test endpoint). All expected strings below are LITERAL
from the code unless marked (semantic).

Legend for grading each of 4 users (alpha/beta/charlie/delta):
  PASS    = meets hard criteria
  PARTIAL = responds but misses a hard criterion / wrong tool / weak
  FAIL    = no response, crash, wrong/empty, or leaked another user's data
Per question I record: expected, the 4 user responses, a per-user grade + reason, spot-checked fact, elapsed.

HARNESS NOTES (code-derived):

- test endpoint sets channelType='admin-test' -> Wave-1 upload completion push is SUPPRESSED
  for these users (only real wa/telegram get the "done" push). So G9 is verified by a FOLLOW-UP
  question ("what is this doc about"), not by waiting for a push.
- /forget clears consent:{user} -> next msg returns CONSENT_MESSAGE. So Q92 MUST be last per user,
  and after it the NEXT msg per user is expected to be the consent prompt (that itself is a graded check).
- Rate limiter runs per user after consent. 4 users in parallel is fine; same-user rapid-fire may trip
  it -> harness paces sequential per-user chains with a small gap, parallelizes ACROSS users only.
- Multi-turn recall (G20) requires an ordered same-user chain; cache:chat_history is busted each turn.
- profile SHOW reads cache:profile (set by SET) for 120s -> set->show in-window must reflect new values.

Q102 What did I just tell you about myself? expected: recalls name + "teacher" (HARD: both facts).
Q103 Earlier you mentioned the weather in Tokyo — what was it?  expected: recalls the Tokyo weather figure from earlier turn (HARD: needs Q32 Tokyo weather to have run earlier in SAME user's chain; harness orders it so).

-- EDGE --
Q102e (ask in different words) "Remind me who I am?"  expected: same recall.

## EXECUTION PLAN

Per user (alpha,beta,charlie,delta), per round (1 and 2):
  Phase A (parallel across users, sequential within): non-destructive groups in dependency order:
     G1(+edges) -> G2 -> G3 -> G4 -> G5 -> G6 -> G7 -> G8(ordered) -> G9(upload+QA) -> G10(vision)
     -> G11 -> G12(ordered) -> G13 -> G14 -> G15 -> G16 -> G20(ordered multi-turn) -> G19(edges)
  Phase B (LAST, per user): G18 incl. Q92 /forget + Q92-post consent check, then re-consent ("yes").
  Pacing: ~0.6-1.0s gap between same-user msgs (rate-limit safe); 4 users run concurrently (threads).
  Persistence: results -> beta_v2_round{N}_results.json  {round,user,group,qid,question,expected,response,elapsed,error_ref}
  Pre-round reset: clear discovery:{user} + ensure consent granted (seed consent hash) so G1 onboarding edges are deterministic.
  Stall-guard: per-call 50s timeout; per-user watchdog; if a call errors, record + continue (never block the round).
Grading: I (the model) read each JSON row and assign PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL vs the expected above, per user.
Between rounds: fix real defects (code), push via GitHub API, deploy, await ECS rollout, re-clear state, run Round 2.
Total approx: ~115 question-slots x 4 users x 2 rounds ~= 920 live calls (within agreed cost).
